Day 7, the week is over and it is time for the battle royal. The three warriors walk out the door and head to the fighting grounds. The minions arrive at the spot early and await the arrival of the warriors. "Man what is taking them so long" says Metelica. "They will be here, don't worry" replies Viltron. "Look up ahead" says Felix as he points towards the warriors. Miguel, Resa, and Snook calmly walk towards the minions. Dust flies around the warriors as they walk. A certain feel of unimaginable strength surrounds them. They finally arrive and stop right in front of the minions. "So how do you want to do this" asks Resa. "Well we will fight one on one. I'm going to fight first, you pick who fights against me" answers Viltron. "Hmm I'll fight you first" responds Resa. "Are you sure..." says Miguel as Resa cuts him off with a cold stare. Miguel then acknowledges that she has everything under control. Miguel and Snook back up a few steps when Viltron unleashes a barrier around them locking them inside. "Hey let us out" yells Snook. "Listen, you're in there so you can't interfere while we battle. If I lose the barrier will obviously disappear" says Viltron. "What's stopping Metelica and Felix from entering the battle" replies Miguel. "There will be no need for us to help him out" respond Felix. "Alright now that everything is settled. Resa shall we begin?" says Viltron. Resa looks at him and smiles. Her eyes suddenly turn completely white, and the sky starts to tremble and sounds of thunder occur. Miguel and Snook look in shock as it is there first time seeing this attack too. Viltron quickly fires four blasts that surround Resa and then the blasts fly into her. However, the blast disintegrate as they get close to Resa. "What's going on?" demands Viltron. "I have a wind shield surrounding my body in order for me to build up energy for this attack" replies Resa. Viltron smirks and backs up a few steps, "Ultimate Ray Beam!!!" he yells. The attack rages towards Resa. Resa lowers her body for an attack and connects her hands at the palms. "Tornado, Twister, Hurricane Ha" screams Resa as all three devastating storms come from the sky and then form in between her hands. Then the attack launches from her hands and hits Viltron's attack. Both attacks cancel each other out causing a massive explosion. Resa secretly starts her next move during the explosion. The area clears with both fighters still standing. Resa just jabs her right fist and Viltron is hit across the face. Viltron looks around wondering what how he just got hit since Resa is a good twenty feet away from. Resa just smiles and continues to unleash a barrage of punches and kick from where she is standing. All of which hit Viltron. Miguel and Snook look on as Resa puts on a show. Metelica and Felix yell at Viltron to not let her do that to him. Viltron turns and says, "Don't you think I know that." Viltron starts rushing in and continues to be hit by Resa's attacks. When Felix  fires and sneak attack blast from under the ground. The blast hits Resa, allowing Viltron a brief moment to attack. Viltron gets right in Resa's face and smirks. "It's my turn now girl" says Viltron as he begins his assault. Viltron starts pounding on Resa not giving her a chance to resist. "Oh no, Resa's in trouble" says Snook. "I know" replies Miguel as he begins to power up. "Hold on Snook, I'm going to reach my full power in order to break us out of this barrier and save Resa" stats Miguel. "Okay" replies Snook as she backs up as far as she can. Then a strange power source is felt by everyone. "What is that?" says Snook. "I don't know, I've never felt anyone with this much power before" replies Miguel. "Is that King Zephion?" asks Metelica. "I doubt it, I've never felt him assert this much power before" responds Felix. Viltron drops the bloody, completely beaten Resa to the ground. Everyone continues to look up in the sky wondering who the monstrous power could be coming for, and why is that person heading there way.
