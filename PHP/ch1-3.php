ZIP!!! The children return back to their home in the exact positions they were in before Denku transported them. Now time has resumed. "That's right little girl, back up and let us boys play," says Sphinx. Resa just looks at him. "What's with the cold stares?" says Felix, shocked as he realizes the children aren't afraid of them. "Don't you know who we are? We are..." says Tankur. "You are demons. Minions of King Zephion" says Tokan as he cuts Tankur off. Felix smirks, and says "And how would you know that." Miguel replies, "Wouldn't you like to know." "Now here are your options. You can leave here peacefully, or we can make you leave!" states Tokan. "Make us leave" replies Sphinx. Tokan and Miguel look at each other and then hold up their left hands. They swing their right arms to the left, then to the right, and back to the left and lock their wrist. Each hold up the correct finger formation for their element. "Fire!!!" yells Tokan. "Earth!!!" yells Miguel. "That was so cool" says Snook. The minions look at the boys and then prepare to fight. "You know what? We forgot to ask how what he meant by being creative with our powers, all we know how to do is just activate them and deactivate them." Tokan whispers to Miguel. "You're right, well lets just fight and hope we don't have to use our powers." replies Miguel. The boys and the demons stare each other down. The demons drop back outside for a bigger area to fight on and the boys follow. "All right lets do this!!! Tankur you stay back for now" says Felix. "Oh man I never get to fight first" replies Tankur. Felix and Sphinx rush in to attack. Tokan and Miguel brace themselves and fight. BOOM!!! Felix punches Tokan, but Tokan blocks the punch. Though his body is pushed back by the force of the punch. "Man they're strong" thinks Tokan. Resa and Snook rush to the door and watch their brothers fight. Tokan punches Felix back and they start a fury of punches at one another. Sphinx goes to punch Miguel but he dodges and counters Sphinx's punch with a kick to the head. Sphinx stumbles back angrily. Miguel smiles but quickly loses his smile as Sphinx rushes in to attack again. Tankur grows tired of watching the others fight and looks over to the girls. He decides to have some fun of his own and attack Resa and Snook. "Hey Resa that other one keeps looking at us," says Snook. Resa turns to look at Tankur and then he starts heading towards them. Miguel notices what Tankur is doing. "Yo Tokan, the other is heading for Resa and Snook" yells Miguel. Tokan turns and tries to head towards the girls but Felix stops him. Resa quickly activates her power. "Wind!!!" Resa yells. Snook backs up behind Resa. Resa holds out her hands in front of her hoping something will happen before Tankur gets too close. Tokan roundhouse kicks Felix, but Felix blocks it. Tokan however follows through with a right hand punch, knocking Felix down. Tokan turns to Tankur, locks his hands together creating a C-shape. Hoping something will come out, he yells "Fireball!!!" To his surprise a ball of fire generates in his palms. He aims the fireball at Tankur, who isn't paying attention, and fires it. Miguel and Sphinx momentarily stop fighting and look. BAAM!!! Tankur is hit by the fireball and is sent flying into a nearby tree. Everyone looks in shock, Tankur gets up slow. "Who did that?" he demands. Tokan replies, "I did." Tankur just turns and looks at him. "How'd you do that bro?" ask Miguel. "Just believe you can do it and it should happen" replies Tokan. "I see you have powers, and it looks like you control the elements. Ha ha I didn't know Denku was still around trying to save the planet Earth. Looks like we should kick it up a notch." says Felix. Sphinx liking what he hears, turns to face Miguel and launches a energy blast at him. "Miguel!!!" shouts Snook. Miguel holds out his hands and yells, "Rock Shield!!!" A shield made of rocks appears in front of him and stops the energy blast. "Your lucky boy" says Sphinx. Resa starts spinning her right index finger in a circle. "I hope this works," she thinks. She points at Tankur, "Whirlwind Ha" she yells. A powerful gust of wind blasts Tankur. "Not again" shouts Tankur as he is sent flying into another tree. Felix and Sphinx jump back to where Tankur landed. "Lets combine our blasts into one and get rid of their warriors right now." says Felix. The three generate energy blast and then move their blasts close to one another creating a bigger energy blast. "Fire!!!" they shout. "Rock Shield" says Miguel, trying to contain the blast. "I can't hold it for long guys" says Miguel. "Hey Resa doesn't wind make fire stronger" asks Tokan. "Yeah it does" replies Resa. "Alright then, we are going to try our own combination attack," says Tokan. "Fireball!!!" yells Tokan. "Whirlwind" shouts Resa. Resa aims her whirlwind at Tokan's fireball. The fireball triples in size and power. "Miguel!!! Drop the shield" yells Tokan. Miguel drops the shield and moves out the way. "Haaaaa" shouts Tokan as he send the huge fireball into the energy blast. BOOM!!! The two blast connect and disintegrate causing a big gust of dirt to surround the area. "You kids are lucky, we will be back. King Zephion will know what to do with you." said Felix as he and the two other minions fly away. "Yeah you better run away because we are the..." shouts Tokan. "We are the Elemental Warriors" yells Snook as she finishes Tokan's statement. Tokan looks at Snook and says to the minions, "Yeah the Elemental Warriors."
