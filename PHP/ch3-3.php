Out in the mountains Miguel and Snook are training hard. Miguel has been trying hard to achieve the power he once had when he witness the disappearance of Tokan. Snook, on the other hand, has been working on a few new moves to catch the minion off guard. "Hey Miguel, can you help me make a new attack strong enough to inflict a lot of damage on the minion, cause I will have to fight them one on one" asks Snook. "Hold on, I will help you once I'm done" replies Miguel in distracted tone. "Oh okay, hey what are you doing by the way?" says Snook. Miguel sighs, "I'm trying to harness the power I had back then" he says. "Oh that's easy I know how you can do that" responds Snook. Miguel stops what he's doing and looks at Snook. "Really now?" says Miguel. "Yup, you just have to tap into that emotion, since it gives so much power" replies Snook. Miguel looks and smiles. "Okay then. Well lets make a deal. I'm going to help you make a new powerful move and you coach me while I try to tap into that emotion" says Miguel. "Okay deal" replies Snook. Miguel works intensely with Snook for two days. They go through multiple trial runs of attacks. Then finally, Snook pierces through one of the mountains. There is a huge hole in the center of the mountain. "Nice work, now don't forget that attack alright." says Miguel. "Got it" replies Snook. "Alright now lets work on tapping into my emotions" responds Miguel. Miguel begins to power up and Snook stands by him yelling at him trying to remind him of that horrible day. Two more days and two more nights go by. Miguel and Snook return home each day drained and fall right to sleep. And then wake up the next day and head right back out into the mountains.

Back at the demon lair, two days before the battle royal. "Man we should have made that battle today. We've already reached our maximums" says Felix. Viltron turns around and stares at him, "Just hold out, it's almost time" he replies. Felix sighs in depression. Metelica continues his workout right outside of the lair.Felix walks over to the opening in the lair. "Are you going to stop any time soon?" asks Felix. "Nope, you can never be too prepared" replies Metelica. Felix rolls his eyes and heads back into the lair.

It is now day 6, one day left before the battle. "Ahhhhh" yells Miguel as everything around him is blown away including Snook. "You did it, you mastered you power" yells Snook. "Yeah and it feels good. Thanks for your help Snook" replies Miguel. "Any time" responds Snook with a smile. Miguel smiles back and the two warriors head back home. "I see your finally back" says Resa. "Yup and we both accomplished what we set out to do" replies Snook. Miguel just smiles, "Hey did you do any training?" asks Miguel. "Don't worry, all will be revealed tomorrow" responds Resa. The children relax for the remainder of the day and then head to bed for tomorrow the battle begins.
