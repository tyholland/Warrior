"Unbelievable. We got rid of the person we never thought we would be rid of first" says Metelica. Resa reaches out to the spot where Tokan just vanished. "One down, and now your next girl" says Sphinx. Snook looks over to Miguel with tears in her eyes. "Miguel, what just happened to Tokan?" asks Snook in a muffled voice. Still in shock Miguel replies, "I don't know Snook. But he's gone now." "Felix finish off the little girl, and Sphinx finish off Resa. I'll take care of Miguel. Metelica you can just step back for a moment" says Viltron. "Your gonna take care of who, next?" replies Miguel in an angry and strangely calm tone. "Well your two sisters and yourself of course" responds Viltron. The ground around Miguel starts to crumble and cave inwards making a small crater. Small pebbles circle Miguel as his power goes insanely out of control, reaching a whole new level. Miguel then looks up with fury in his eyes. "First things first. I'm gonna avenge Tokan, and then take out the rest of you" announces Miguel as he stares at Sphinx the while time as he speaks. Sphinx timidly backs up a little, and then grabs Resa, who still can't believe Tokan is gone. "Come any closer and I'll finish her right now" says Sphinx. As soon as Sphinx finished saying his last word, Miguel elbowed him in the head and caught Resa as she fell down. "He's so much faster now. He might even be stronger than Tokan" thinks Viltron. Sphinx hits the ground hard. He then looks up at Miguel, "So what now? You gonna call the eternal gate of prison and lock me in there" says Sphinx. Miguel places Resa on the ground, "No the eternal gate of prison is too nice of a place for you" replies Miguel. Sphinx then looks at Miguel with fear and tries to escape for his life. "Sand Coffin" says Miguel as he holds his hand out towards the running Sphinx. Sphinx is instantly stopped by the ground. A coffin of sand appears from behind Sphinx. Sphinx turns in fear to see the coffin and then is engulfed by the coffin. Miguel then closes his hand making a fist and the coffin gets squashed as if some gigantic hand had just grabbed it. Then the coffin is lowered into the depths of the earth. Miguel slowly turns his head towards Felix whose holding Snook. Felix looks stunned to see Miguel's increase in power. "You might want to put her down nicely, right now" demands Miguel. Before Felix can say anything, Miguel already moved in for the attack. But Viltron comes out of nowhere and blocks him. "You may have got a power increase, but I'm still just as strong" says Viltron. "Then why are you shaking, while your trying to hold me back" replies Miguel. In one swift movement, Miguel releases and grabs Snook. He moves her to where Resa lays. "Stay here, everything will be alright once I return" says Miguel as he covers them with his diamond shield. All feed up with what has happened, Metelica fires a blast. "Here takes this. Kamikaze Blast!!!" yells Metelica. Miguel deflects the blast like is was nothing. Miguel lifts his hand up and rocks from the ground go airborne. "Here try my attack. Rock Party!!!" replies Miguel. Metelica is able to block the first set of rocks, but as each set comes, they become sharper and harder. After 30 seconds, Metelica becomes overwhelmed by the attack. Miguel then creates two cinder blocks and tries to slam them with Viltron and Felix in between them. Viltron and Felix both blast one of the cinder blocks. Miguel dashes towards Viltron and attacks him as he blasts the cinder block. Miguel punches Viltron in the head and he goes flying. Felix turns to attack Miguel, but Miguel blocks him. While Miguel holds Felix's arm, he quickly generates a rock ball around his fist and hits Felix in the gut. The force of the hit caused an echo in the area. Felix drops to his knees in agonizing pain. "Game over" says Miguel. But then Viltron hits Miguel upside his head rendering him unconscious. "No matter how strong you are, you can still get knocked out" says Viltron. "Finish him" says Felix who is still in pain. "No problem" replies Viltron. "Eye of the Hurricane!!!" shouts Resa as a blast with the power of a hurricane hits Viltron, launching him into a boulder. The boulder crumbles over Viltron. "Water Cannon" yells Snook, and she hits Felix. Felix goes flying and hits a rather large tree and just falls to the ground. Resa moves Miguel over to her and Snook. "Alright lets head back home before they come to" says Resa. Snook agrees and they leave the area.
