Tokan, Resa, and Miguel span out looking for Snook. They search mountains, caves, and abandoned buildings but come up empty. It's been two days with no sign of Snook, and no trouble on planet Earth. The children head home in hopes that the minions will make communication with them.
<br><br>
Back at the lair, King Zephion questions Snook. "Little girl, how is it that you came upon your power?" asks King Zephion. "We were born with it" responds Snook. King Zephion smirks at her answer. "Ok then, why does your power increase with every battle you have," he says. "Maybe your minions are getting weaker" she replies wittily. "Listen girl I have no time for your childish games" he shouts, but then he notices her glove on her left hand. "Hmm what do we have here? Could this be your power source" says King Zephion as he takes her glove off. "No that's just the new fashion going around" replies Snook. The water element mark on the glove disappears on the glove when King Zephion took it off. King Zephion then realizes that the glove is their power source. He quickly gives the glove to Rex, and has him do a diagnostic on it. "You know what? you guys should be scared because my brothers and sister are looking for me and when they find me, they won't hold back." says Snook. "Then lets arrange a little trade with your siblings once we figured out your power" replies King Zephion. So he has Felix go out and announce to the world that they will have a trade in two days for Snook's life. Felix goes to a local new station, forces his way in, and demands for some air time. The people give him what he wants. Felix announces that in two days, at area 151 in front of the mountains, they will give back Snook if the other warriors hand over their gloves. Resa sees the announcement on TV. She goes and tells Tokan and Miguel. "Alright looks like we have two days of training to do. Then we will make the trade." says Tokan. "You know they are going to attack us as soon as we give them our gloves" replies Miguel. "That's true, but if they found out about the gloves then they should know that once the glove is removed the element disappears." responds Tokan. "Yeah so, what does that have to do with anything" says Resa. "You guys will see in two days what I mean. Come on lets go train and prepare for battle," replies Tokan.
<br><br>
After two days has past, the three warriors are ready and head to area 151. Rex has ran many tests on the glove and has found no power source that comes from the glove. King Zephion has concluded that the glove on gives power to the wielder of the glove. So he keeps the glove close by him at all times. Then King Zephion and his minions head over to area 151. They arrive first and chain Snook up against the mountain and wait for the other warriors to arrive. Then Tokan, Resa, and Miguel appear, walking towards the demons. They stop in front of King Zephion, who is in front of the minions, and see Snook chained up to the mountain. "I see your majesty has decided to grace us with his appearance" says Tokan. "Well I just wanted to see who has given my minions such a hard time. And I wanted to add your gloves to my collection" replies King Zephion. "Well release Snook and we will hand over the gloves" says Resa. "How about at the same time" responds King Zephion. "Alright then, Resa give me your glove and go get Snook," says Tokan. So Resa hands over her glove to Tokan and goes to Snook. Rex is standing by Snook with the key to unlock the chains. Tokan takes Miguel's glove as well and then holds the gloves out in front facing King Zephion. King Zephion signals for Rex to cut the chains lose, and Tokan hands the gloves over. Resa takes Snook and heads back over to where Tokan and Miguel stand. "Well done boy. That was a good trade, but I'm sorry to say that this is the last time I will see you." says King Zephion. "Oh we're so disappointed" replies Miguel. "Hmm as am I. Get them boys," says King Zephion as the minions rise up from above and attack.
