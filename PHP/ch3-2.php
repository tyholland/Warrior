A couple of days go by as the young warriors go on with their lives without their oldest brother, Tokan. Miguel has become quite silent, not really talking much to anyone. He goes to school everyday and then comes home. Sometimes he'll leave the house and other times he will just stay in his room. Resa walks around with a sad face most of the time. She's a little more talkative than Miguel. Though she doesn't talk about Tokan at all, nor does she like people talking about Tokan in her presence. Snook, however, has moved into Tokan's room. She likes to sleep there to remind her of Tokan. All three sibling deeply miss their brother.

Back at the demon lair, "Now that the main runt is gone, the other three should drop like flies" says King Zephion. "Sir, how should we go about attacking them? Because Miguel's power increased dramatically once his brother disappeared" asks Felix. "There's no worries, it was just his emotions kicking in. He won't be able to obtain that power again" replies King Zephion. "Great observation sir" responds Viltron. "I have a idea. I want you to get into contact with one of those brats and tell them to meet us in a week for a battle royal to the end. This way you can power up to your maximums and have no problem of losing" announces King Zephion. The three minions agree and leave King Zephion's room. "Metelica go find one of them and give them the announcement" says Viltron. Metelica then proceeds out of the lair.

Another day begins, and the warriors head off to school. Miguel is finishing up his last class when Adrelina stops him in the hallway. "Hey Miguel, I haven't spoken to you in a while" says Adrelina. "Oh hey Adrelina, sorry just been going through a lot of stuff" replies Miguel. "What's wrong?" asks Adrelina. "Well my brother, Tokan, is gone. The demons got him" responds Miguel. "Oh I'm sorry. But I bet your brother wouldn't want you to be so gloomy for such a long period of time" replies Adrelina. "That's true, he would tell us to take it in and keep going on with life" says Miguel. "Yeah, hey do you want to go for some food after school" asks Adrelina. "Umm sure, why not" replies Miguel. School ends for the day, Miguel and Adrelina go out for a snack. Miguel finally begins to smile again while hanging out with Adrelina. The two are having a good time when the water in their cups starts moving rapidly. "Hey Miguel do you see what I see?" says Adrelina. "Yeah, something bad is coming our way" replies Miguel with a concerned and angry look. Metelica comes flying out of the sky and lands in front of Miguel and Adrelina. Miguel pushes Adrelina behind him and gets ready to activate his power. "Whoa whoa, I'm not here to fight. I'm just letting you know that in a week, we are going to have a battle royal to the end. The three of you versus the three of us. Be there or say goodbye to the Earth" says Metelica. "Hmm no worries, we will be there" responds Miguel. Metelica smirks and then leaves the area. "A fight to the death, are you going to be ok?" asks Adrelina. "Yeah, but I have to cut this short because I have to go home and tell my sisters the news. I'll be talking to you later" replies Miguel. "Ok, bye" responds Adrelina. Miguel quickly heads home to warn his sisters and to start training.

Back at the warriors house, Miguel rushes into the house. "Resa, Snook" yells Miguel. The girls come downstairs to where Miguel is. "What is it Miguel?" says Resa. "The minions have challenged us to a fight to the death in a week" answers Miguel.  "Ok so we have a week until then. What do you want us to do about it now?" responds Resa. "Train obviously. I'm gonna start going up to the mountains everyday and train until it's time to fight" demands Miguel. "Can I go train with you Miguel?" asks Snook. "I'm sorry you can't" responds Miguel. "Pretty please, I won't get in your way at all" says Snook with a sad look on her face. Miguel looks at her and then caves in and lets her train with him.
