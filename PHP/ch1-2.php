"We are free at least," said King Zephion. He looks over at his minions, Felix, Viltron, Metelica, Tankur, Rex, and Sphinx, to see if they are all out. "Good we are all out, I believe it is time to take back what is rightfully ours," says King Zephion. "Right," the minions say. King Zephion tells the minions to split up in two groups of three and go around and let the world know that they are back. While they do that, King Zephion heads back to his out to his old lair. Felix, Tankur, and Sphinx head east and Viltron, Metelica, and Rex west.

Elsewhere above the planet Earth on a cloud, Denku searches for four warriors through his crystal ball. But do to the Earth being so peaceful for many years, there aren't any warriors to choose from. Denku fears for the worst, so he pays close attention to the minions.
<br><br>
On Earth, in a little home just outside the city, lays a family of six. A mom, dad, and four children. The children are Tokan, the oldest, Resa, the second oldest, Miguel, the third oldest, and Snook, who is the youngest. Mom and dad have already gone to work for the day and the children are home from school by themselves. Tokan and Miguel like to spar with one another, just to stay sharp on their fighting skills if they ever needed to defend themselves. Resa knows how to spar but isn't a big fan of fighting and Snook watches her two brothers spar and is allowed to spar with them every once and a while. All four children exceptionally strong for their ages.

Felix, Tankur, and Sphinx fly over a home just before they reach the main city. "Man I'm really hungry," states Felix. "Obviously since we've been trapped in that capsule for so many years," replies Sphinx. "Well there's a house right below us, why don't we stop in and get some food," says Felix. "Sounds like a plan to me," answers Tankur. So the minions head down to the house and up to the door. KNOCK KNOCK!!! Tokan hears from the door. "Who could that be," thinks Tokan. But he goes to the door to answer it when, BOOM!!! the door explodes into pieces. "What's going on?," yells Miguel as he races to the front door. "I don't know bro, but it doesn't look good," replies Tokan. Three figures emerge from the dust into the house. "Hello there kids, we're hungry so give us your food," says Felix. "And if we don't," answers Tokan. "Oh we got a gusty one here," states Tankur. "Well maybe if you guys just didn't break our door we would be a little more helpful," says Miguel. "You know what we don't even need your permission. We are just going to take the food the easy way or the hard way," replies Sphinx. "Hey what happened?," says Resa as she walks into the room with Snook. "Stay back," demands Tokan, "We got a little trouble on our hands." Resa and Snook back up a little. Denku, watching from above on his crystal, senses the warriors spirit in the two boys, Tokan and Miguel, as well as something from the two girls. He quickly uses his ability to freeze time on Earth and transports the four children above to him.

ZIP!!! "What just happened?," says Miguel. "I'd like to know myself and I'd to know where we are now?," replies Tokan. "You are on a cloud up above the Earth. Hi, my name is Denku and I'm the guardian of the Earth," says Denku. The four children turn away to see Denku. "Those three demons that you just encountered are minions of King Zephon," says Denku. "Ok that's nice to know, but how does that affect us?," states Resa. "Well long ago before you were born they ruled the planet Earth, but four warriors captured them in a capsule and they locked in there for many years. But that monstrous earthquake that you just had, released them. There is King Zephion, and then six minions. I want you four to become my new warriors and stop them." replies Denku. "Are you serious? There are real demons out there as you say and you want us four normal kids to stop them. Dude they probably have powers and I can assure you we have none." says Tokan. "Yes they have powers. But you four will soon have some of your own. I have four gloves here that each of you will take. Once you take the gloves, the element that best fits you will emerge on the glove. The elements are fire, earth, wind, and water." replies Denku. "That sounds pretty cool," says Miguel. "Can we do it Tokan" asks Snook. "One second Snook. Say we do this how do we activate our power, and then do we keep the power until we defeat this King Zephion." says Tokan. "First off the gloves go on your left hand. To activate your power you have to bring your right arm around to the left side of your body, then back to the right side of your body, and then back and lock your wrists together. Then depending on your element you will have to hold up a certain amount of fingers on your left hand. For fire, you just hold down your index finger and thumb, leaving the rest up. For earth, you hold down your middle finger and thumb, leaving the rest up. For wind, you hold down your ring finger and thumb, leaving the rest up. And finally for water, you just hold down your pinky and thumb, leaving the rest up. Then to deactivate your powers, just say power down." replies Denku. "Ha ha that sounds simple" replies Resa sarcastically. "I guess it's a little hard at first, but once you get the hang of it it will be a breeze. But here, each of you take a glove and put it on your left hand. Oh and remember your power feeds on your emotions. Also be creative with your attacks, and they will just come to you naturally" says Denku. The four children huddle up and talk amongst themselves and decide to take Denku up on his offer. So they each take a glove and put it on. Whoosh!!! A light hits each child and then an element appears on each of their gloves. Tokan gets fire, Resa receives wind, Miguel has earth, and Snook gets water. The children look one another and each of their elements and are happy. "Ok I'm going to have to send you back now, because I froze time on Earth and I won't be able to keep time frozen for much longer. If you need to contact me, just yell out my name and I'll just communicate with you by talking with our thoughts. Good luck my warriors." says Denku. "Thanks, we'll do our best" replies Tokan.
