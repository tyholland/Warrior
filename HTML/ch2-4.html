At the demon lair, "How did those little brats survive that blast" yells King Zephion. The minions look at him but don't respond. "Hmm get out of my sight and don't return until one or all of the brats are gone" demands King Zephion. The minions leave and head to their lounge area. "Alright it's just the four of us now, and there's only four of them. So without a doubt we should be able to take them out" says Viltron. "Lets take out Tokan first, then the others will drop like flies" states Sphinx. "The only problem with that idea is that Tokan is strong and I'm sure the others won't let us fight him one on four" responds Felix. "I have an idea" says Metelica. "Well what is it?" replies Viltron. "Why don't we take out Resa, since she fuels all of their powers" says Metelica. "Good idea. With her gone, they will only be able to reach a certain limit in their powers" responds Felix. "Then it's settled then, we'll get rid of Resa" says Viltron. "I'll use my dimension attack to get rid of her" says Sphinx. "Good thinking. Alright lets move out" replies Viltron.

The warriors have had a few stress free days, since the minions have been in hiding since their last attack. "Hey I'm going to hang out with some friends. I'll be back later" says Miguel. "Alright man, we'll see you later on then" replies Tokan. Tokan, Resa, and Snook stay home and watch a movie. Miguel ends up at the basketball courts and plays a few pick up games with his friends. Everyone finished playing ball, and packed up their gear and headed home. Miguel and his friend Kryil are walking home, when all of sudden Miguel can sense a strong power ending his way. "Hey Kryil, I left something back at the courts. I'm gonna go back, go ahead home without me" says Miguel. "Are you sure man" replies Kryil. "Yeah, I'll be fine" responds Miguel as he turns and looks back at Kryil as to warn him to get as far away from him as he can. Kryil quickly walks away and the four minions appear. "Well if it isn't my four best friends" says Miguel. "Your funny Miguel. Where's you brother and sisters?" replies Sphinx. "Wouldn't you like to know" responds Miguel. Miguel quickly activates his power. "Oh man, do I love watching you do that" says Viltron sarcastically. Tokan instantly feels Miguels power. "Hey movies over, Miguel just powered up. Which means trouble, lets go" says Tokan. The three warriors leave the house in a flash and run to where they sense Miguel's power. However Miguel and Metelica have already begun to fight. "Man what's taking the other three. I'm getting tired of watching them fight" says Sphinx. BAAM!!! Sphinx gets hit by a wind bullet. Viltron and Felix look up to see Tokan, Resa, and Snook walking in their direction. "Don't forget the plan Sphinx. You take Resa and we will handle the other two." says Viltron. "Yeah yeah, I got it" replies Sphinx. Viltron and Felix rush Tokan and Snook. Resa, realizing the power mismatch with Snook and Felix, starts to head towards Snook to help her out when Sphinx stops her in her tracks. "Hey Tokan and Miguel, watch Snook. She's at a disadvantage with Felix. As for you Sphinx, I'm gonna take you down quick so I can help them." says Resa. "Don't make me laugh girl" replies Sphinx as he proceeds with a right punch into Resa's face. Resa uses the little air between her and Sphinx's fist as a shield and makes it look like Sphinx's punch connected. She then comes with a uppercut, knocking Sphinx on his back. Sphinx becomes angry and they engage in battle.

Snook is knocked down to the ground. "Man why do I have to fight the small fry. Might as well finish her off" says Felix as he stands over Snook. Felix stops abruptly because he notices that Snook's eyes are closed and she seems to be mumbling something. He looks around but doesn't see and water attack coming in his direction. "What are you doing girl?" says Felix. Snook opens her eyes, brings her hands together, and points at Felix. "Water bolt" replies Snook as a bolt of liquid comes flying from the sky. Felix dodges the bolt and it goes into the ground. "Ha you missed little girl" says Felix. All of a sudden the bolt comes from under ground and hits Felix. "Oh I forgot to tell you it doesn't stop until it hits its target." replies Snook. Tokan takes a quick look over at Snook and sees that she's fine at the moment and continues his battle with Viltron. "You shouldn't look away boy. It could turn out to be bad for you." says Viltron. "Like I'm scared of you, Viltron" responds Tokan.

Sphinx punches Resa, knocking her to the ground. Resa spits out a little blood. "See girl, you can handle me. Now say good bye to your siblings" says Sphinx. Sphinx begins to power up, he yells "Dimensional Bomb!!!" Resa quickly throws up her wind shield. "Ha ha ha ha, your shield will be of no help with this attack. It goes through everything until it touches a life force" says Sphinx. Resa, in shock, is unable to move. Tokan sees that Resa is in trouble and runs to her aid. He throws multiple blasts at the dimensional bomb but nothing phases it. "Resa get out of its way" shouts Tokan. Everyone stops and looks as the bomb is about to hit Resa and Sphinx is laughing uncontrollably in a sinister way. When Tokan comes flying out of nowhere and jumps in front of Resa and the bomb hits him. "Ahhhhhh" yells Tokan as his body shrinks into the bomb. Then in the blink of an eye, both Tokan and the bomb disappear.
