Meanwhile Viltron, Meletica, and Rex have entered a city in the west side of the planet Earth. They have already made followers of the people in the city. They also had to make examples of the people who didn't want to follow under King Zephion's command by destroying them. "Now as followers of King Zephion, you will have to pay a monthly fee to be able to live here on his planet. Your fee for the town will be $5 million. If you can't pay the monthly fee then this city will be destroyed with all of you in it." said Viltron as he tells the citizens. "Yeah, we won't be collecting today but we will return soon. So make sure you have your money ready. Until have a good day ha ha ha." said Rex. The three minions fly away off to their next city to take over.

Felix, Sphinx, and Tankur return to the old lair where King Zephion had been. King Zephion had fixed up the lair to make it feel like it did once before while the minions were out. "What are you three doing back so early. How many cities were you able to get to follow under my command?" said King Zephion. The three minions kneel down on one knee and bow their head. "My sire, we were interrupted and weren't able to retain any cities." replied Felix. "What!!!!" yelled King Zephion angrily. "We meet four warriors who had power like the ones from long ago. They looked very young and I'm sure they weren't used to using their powers yet. But they were able to hold up back. My deepest apologies." replied Felix in a scared tone. "Hmm it appears that Denku is still around. And that he has recruited some new children. But I'm sure he didn't think we were gonna be freed, so the children most likely aren't prepared. Very well you are off the hook for now." said King Zephion. King Zephion quickly summons Viltron, Metelica, and Rex to return to the lair. They return within moments, they then kneel and bow their heads just as the other three do. "Well it seems that we have a new foe to take out. And this time we will not get trapped into that capsule again. Four new warriors that are new to their powers should not be a problem for you to destroy, am I right?" demanded King Zephion. "Yes sire" all the minions reply. "Alright then, go and show them why they shouldn't have interfered with us!!!" said King Zephion.
<br><br>
Back at the house just outside the city, where the four children reside. "Man that was crazy" said Tokan. "Yeah, they were tough. Though using our powers was pretty cool." replied Miguel. "I know right, plus the more imaginative we are, the more things we can do with our powers." says Resa. "True, but now they know where we live so we have to stay sharp because they could attack and any moment." states Tokan. "Yup and I'm going to tear them up when they return too." says Snook. The other three laugh at Snook as she tries to act tough. "We have to get a new door too, don't forget." says Tokan. "We should do it now before mom and dad get home," replies Resa. "Alright. Hey Snook want to ride with me to the store and get a new door?," asks Tokan. "Sure I'll go," answers Snook. Tokan and Snook get in the car and head into the city to buy a new door. Miguel and Resa stay at the house. Miguel stays outside and works on some of his fighting technics. Resa goes inside the house and watches some tv. Resa suddenly yells for Miguel to get in the house. Miguel rushes in and asks, "What's wrong?" "Look at the news" replies Resa. The news channel stated that multiple cities on the west side of the Earth have been taken under the control of a so called King Zephion. There have been many casualties of rebellious people who didn't want to follow King Zephion. "This is terrible," says Miguel. "I know, we have to stop those guys before they cause anymore harm." states Resa. "No doubt, we will definitely stop them" answers Miguel.

All six minions leave the lair and head towards the home of the elemental warriors. Upon reaching their destination, the minions notice that only two of the warriors are home. "Hmm only two of them are here. Lets split into the two groups we were in earlier." says Viltron. "Fine, my group will go find the other two. You guys stay here and take care of these two." replies Felix. So Felix and his group head over to the city since it was the next closest place to look for the other two warriors. Viltron and his group land in front of the house.
