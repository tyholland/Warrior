"Fire!!!, Wind!!!, Earth!!!" yells the three warriors as they quickly slip on their real gloves and do their power activations. "Wall of fire" yells Tokan as he shields himself and the other three from the minions. "Wind shotgun" shouts Resa as she shoots wind bullets throw the wall of fire making the wind bullets become burning bullets hitting the minions. During all the action, Miguel burrows underground to where King Zephion stands in anger. Miguel then comes up from the ground, surprising King Zephion and grabs back the case containing all the gloves he was holding. Then Miguel heads back underground. "You little brats, think you can trick me and get away with it." says King Zephion. "Death Beam Cannon!!!" yells King Zephion as he releases one of his most devastating attacks on the elemental warriors. Miguel returns to where his siblings are, he hands Snook's glove to her, and sees the attack coming. "Diamond Shield!!!" yells Miguel. "Wind Barrier!!!" screams Resa. "Mega Flame Shield!!!" shouts Tokan. The three protective walls goes up instantly in hope of stopping the blast. The blast goes right through the first, second, and third shield easily. "Water bubble" yells Snook as she covers herself and her siblings in a ball of water which is engulfed by the blast. Luckily Snook's water bubble is able to deflect the blast all around the bubble, but they are carried off by the force of the blast. They taken a long way before the they hit a rock and the bubble explodes and they go flying. King Zephion and his minions, however, are under the impression that the elemental warriors were destroyed by the blast.

"Is everyone alright" says Tokan as he slowly gets up. "Yeah," reply the other children. The warriors then head home clean up their injuries and to relax. King Zephion and his minions as head back to their lair, happy that they had gotten rid of the elemental warriors once and for all. As a new day arrives, the warriors are exhausted and glad to have Snook back. However the minions are planning their next city to take over under the name of King Zephion. Viltron, Metelica, and Rex arrive at a city not too far from the warriors house. As they take control of the city, the citizens cry out for the elemental warriors. The minions reassure them that they have destroyed the elemental warriors and there was no one to save them. A news reporter reports from the city that another city has been taken over and that the elemental warriors have been destroyed. The reporter also mentioned that other cities should prepare for the worst. "Tokan!!!" yells Snook. "What's up Snook?" replies Tokan. "There's trouble in a nearby city, and I think people think we are dead" responds Snook. "Thats a little weird, but no matter. Lets suite up and go save that city. Miguel, Resa, we are out." says Tokan. "Lets do it" replies Miguel. The warriors move out to the city where the minion currently are at.

"Now don't forget to pay your monthly fees to stay alive" says Rex. All of a sudden the sky turns dark and begins to rain. "Thats odd for it to be raining all of a sudden." says Viltron. "Earthquake!!!" shouts Miguel as the ground around the three minions begins to shake and separate. "what!!! No way, you guys are supposed to be dead" says Metelica. "Surprise, we alive" replies Resa. The citizens rejoice at the sight of the elemental warriors. Tokan signals for Snook to clear the skies. The rain disappears and Tokan goes and jumps as high as he can positioning himself in line with the sun. "Solar Fare Beam!!!" yells Tokan as he fires a fiery beam down at the minion. The minions move out the way, and the spot where they were just standing is burned to a crisp. "Man that would have hurt" says Rex. Miguel turns and surrounds the minion with a ring of spikes and has the spikes close in on them. Viltron immediately eliminates the spikes. "Just who do you think you are messing with" states Viltron. Resa then fires her wind shotgun at Viltron. Metelica counters it with a blast of his own. "Meteor Blast" yells Rex as he blasts it at Snook. Miguel throws up his diamond shield to protect Snook. "Miguel call out the prison" says Tokan. "Eternal Gate of Prison!!!" shouts Miguel. "Just because the eternal gate of prison is here doesn't mean your going to trap us in it" says Viltron. "Aqua Blast" yells Snook. "Wind Chill" shouts Resa. As they attack the minions from opposite sides forcing the minions to jump in the air directly above the eternal gate of prison. Tokan who is hiding in the glare of the sun, shouts "Flames of The Dragon!!!" He lets out a very powerful bast with fire spiraling around it. Viltron and Metelica sense the attack and move out of the way. Rex however wasn't able to move out of the way quick enough and is engulfed by the attack. Rex is blasted down, right into the eternal gate of prison. "Darn it, they got Rex now" says Metelica. "It doesn't matter, I have a plan now. But we will need the other two to help us, lets go for now" says Viltron. The minions vanish out of sight and Miguel closes the gate. All the citizens scream and cheer on the elemental warriors for saving them again. The warriors then head back home.
