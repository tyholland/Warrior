The minions return back to the lair. "Sire, they have captured Tankur in the eternal gate or prison" says Felix. "Sire, they also seem to be a lot strong wen they are together. It's like they feed off each others powers." says Viltron. "Hmm well then it seems you must attack them when they are separated then," demands King Zephion. "Yes sire" they all reply. The minions go off into another room and devise a new strategy of attack.

Meanwhile at the home of the elemental warriors, the children are resting from battle. Resa is watching the news when she notices something interesting. "Hey guys come look at the news, we're on the TV" says Resa. The other three children come rushing to the TV to see themselves. The reporter on the television states that are four new heroes to save them from the evil King Zephion, who has taken control of most of the west side of the planet. The reporter continues to say that the warriors are known as the elemental warriors. The children smile to see that they have become famous. "Nice I wasn't expecting to become famous after receiving our powers, but how cool is this," says Miguel. "It's very cool, but lets try and keep a low profile. No using your powers unless those demons are attacking, alright." responds Tokan. "Alright" the other three reply.
<br><br>
The next day arrives and the children get themselves ready for school as they normal would. However, the minions have finished making their new plan and have begun to make their move. Tokan and Resa both head off to high school. They are seniors and are getting ready to graduate high school. Miguel and Snook are still in middle school. Miguel is in 8th grade and Snook is in 6th grade. All four children head to their respective classes, but as they walk into the building and all the other students see them, everyone starts applauding them and cheering. The other students treat the warriors like their are celebrities since they were seen on the news last night. But the school day continues once the school bell rings and everyone heads to class. On the roof of the middle school the minions land. "Alright, I'll attack the earth boy. The rest of you guys, know what you're doing?" says Viltron. "Yeah yeah, we do. Lets go," replies Felix. The minions move out. As Miguel sits in class, he starts to feel a sense of danger. BOOM!!! An energy blast comes blasting through the side of the building hitting Miguel knocking him off his desk. Viltron steps into the classroom through the whole his energy blast made. All the students and the teacher scurry to the corner of the room. "Shouldn't be learning instead of laying on the ground boy," says Viltron. "I mean it would be nice to learn if people didn't go around hitting you with energy blasts," replies Miguel as he stands up. "Oh that's my bad" respond Viltron as he vanishes and then reappears in front of Miguel. The two stare each other down for a few seconds and then start fighting. Miguel throws a right hook, Viltron blocks it and counters with a right punch to the gut of Miguel. Miguel stumbles back but as he looks up Viltron hits him with a uppercut, flipping Miguel backwards onto the ground. Miguel begins to activate his power but Viltron stops him in the process. "Nope, no powers for you boy," says Viltron as he pulls Miguel up by his own hand. Miguel spits in Viltron's face and Viltron kicks Miguel into the wall.

At the high school, Tokan just got a sharp pain feeling in his back. "Something's wrong," Tokan thinks to himself. Tokan asks to be excused from the classroom. Tokan walks to a window in the hallway where he can see the middle school from. He quickly notices that the building has a random whole in it. Tokan instantly starts running out of the high school and towards the middle school. Resa is sitting in class and day dreaming when she looks out the window and sees Tokan sprinting towards the middle school. She then asks to be excused from the class to see what's going on. As Tokan is running he activates his power. "Ah!!!" Tokan hears as he gets closer to the middle school. "Miguel" Tokan thinks. Tokan then sees Viltron in the classroom. "Fireball" yells Tokan as he launches it right at Viltron. Viltron turns to see the fireball coming at him, and deflects it. But right as he deflected it, Tokan comes flying in and punches him rite in the face. "Miguel you alright" says Tokan. "Yeah, just a little roughed up" replies Miguel. The students stare in awe.
Snook hears all the commotion coming from upstairs and heads out of her classroom to see what was going on when Felix, Metelica, and Rex stop her. "What are you guys doing here" says Snook as she steps back. "Getting ready to take you home," replies Felix as Sphinx comes from behind Snook and knocks her unconscious. "Alright lets get Viltron and get out of here" says Rex. "I got him," replies Metelica. They vanish with Snook. Viltron gets up and gets ready to attack Tokan when he gets the signal to leave. "Well I guess we will have to finish this later fire boy" says Viltron as he leaves the fight. Resa now enters the classroom. "What happened?" she asks. "I don't know. He just came in attacked and then left" answers Miguel. Tokan looks up into the sky thinking that something wasn't right. "Oh no, where's Snook?" says Tokan. Resa and Miguel turn and look at each other. "Shouldn't she be in her class" replied Resa. The warriors go to the office and have them call for Snook over the intercom. They wanted ten minutes and Snook never showed. "They must of set us up to capture Snook" said Tokan. "They just started a whole new war, taking Snook like that." replied Miguel. The warriors look up towards the sky thinking of how they are going to rescue Snook.
