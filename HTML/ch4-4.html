The four warriors huddle up behind the barriers. "Alright we need to come up with a plan quick or it's over" says Resa. "But what can we do, we've been beaten by this guys and he took away our super powered forms" replies Miguel. The first barriers down and the death ball moves forward. "Wait I got an idea. Just before King Zephion hit me with the power punch, he told me that I would never be able to beat him with my element alone" states Tokan. "So do you mean if we combine all our powers together we can beat him" replies Snook. "Yeah thats the plan, I don't know if it will work though" responds Tokan. "Ok, but how are we going to hit him with this attack?" asks Miguel. "Its got to be a direct hit, up close and personal" answers Resa. "Exactly, and I'm going to be the one to do it" says Tokan. Now the second shield has been broken down. "Alright everyone generate as much of your power that you can into an orb and then place it in my hand" says Tokan. "Right!!!" reply the three warriors. When all the warriors combine their powers into one attack they give birth to the Elemental Orb. "Yes we did. Now Snook I need you to use your final blow one more time and fire it at the death ball. Resa I need you to use your wind cutter" commands Tokan. "Alright, Final Blow!!!" shouts Snook. "Wind Cutter!!!" shouts Resa. Snook's attacks breaks through the barrier and goes right into the death ball and Resa's attack follows. "Okay, here I go wish me luck" says Tokan as follows right behind the girls attack. The girls combined attack on the death ball causes it to split in half. The two halves of the death ball go flying up into space. 
<br><br>
"How did they break through my death ball. No matter I will still crush them" thinks King Zephion. The girl's attack races towards King Zephion and he just bats it off into space with his left arm. "Did you think that would stop me, children" shouts King Zephion. "Not at all" Tokan shouts back. King Zephion looks up and sees Tokan in the sky and rushes down towards him. "Didn't I already tell you that your element can't destroy me" says King Zephion. "Yeah you did, but this attack is from all four of us" replies Tokan as he holds the Elemental Orb in front of him as he flies down at King Zephion. "Now take this, Elemental Orb!!!" yells Tokan as he encounters King Zephion. "Hahaha bring it on" says King Zephion. King Zephion goes to block the attack with his left arm and attack pierces through his arm and hits his chest directly. "What's going on?" asks King Zephion in fear. "Well since you said my element alone couldn't defeat you, then I figured I would use all four of our powers and guess what it works. Now say goodbye King Zephion" responds Tokan. "Noooo!!!" yells King Zephion as his body is destroyed by the attack. An explosion is created as King Zephion's body is destroyed and Tokan is knocked out by the explosion and sent flying.
<br><br>
The other warriors see Tokan's body get sent flying and they notice that he seems to be unconscious. "Miguel go get Tokan" demands Resa. Miguel moves as soon as Resa gives out the command. He grabs Tokan and brings him back to where the girls are at. "Is he okay?" asks Snook. "Yeah he's fine, just knocked out at the moment" answers Miguel. Resa looks over to where King Zephion stood. "It's finally over" says Resa. "So did we win?" asks the newly awaken Tokan. "Sure did" answers Snook. "Well at that's left is to go home" says Miguel. The warriors look at each and smile in triumph. Then they finally walk home.
