Now with all the minions taken care of, Tokan walks over to Snook, Miguel, and Resa to check on Resa. "How is she doing?" asks Tokan. "She will be fine now, all healed" answers Snook. Then off in the distance, a dark figure is clapping. The warriors hear the clapping. "Well down warriors, well done" says the mysterious figure. "Who's there?" demands Miguel. "Oh I am hurt that you guys don't remember me. It's your pal, King Zephion" replies King Zephion. "I don't remember us being friends" says Tokan. "That is true, but I'm here to offer you guys a chance to work with me and be my new right hand men" states King Zephion. "I think we will pass, since we've been spending this whole time trying to get rid of you and your minions" responds Resa. "Think of it as a new opportunity to be on top of the world" says King Zephion. "I don't know if you heard her or not, but we aren't going to join sides with the likes of you" replies Tokan. "Well then, I guess I'm going to have to destroy you instead" responds King Zephion. King Zephion then jumps down closer to the warriors. Tokan and Miguel turn to face King Zephion. Tokan holds his right hand down signaling to the girls that will not be needed in this fight. The two warriors stare King Zephion down.

"Alright let the fighting begin" shouts King Zephion, as he vanishes at an unbelievable speed. Tokan looks around as he is able to see glimpses of King Zephion. "Miguel, behind you" shouts Tokan, and Miguel turns to block King Zephion's attack. "Oh you can see me" says King Zephion. Miguel counters with a right hook to the face of King Zephion. King Zephion doesn't move at all and takes the punch straight on. "Nice punch boy, but you're still not strong enough yet to harm me" says King Zephion as goes to punch Miguel. Tokan steps in and blocks King Zephion. King Zephion looks at Tokan and grins. He then grabs Tokan, and launches him through a tree into a boulder. Then he vanishes and Miguel loses sight of him again. Miguel then hears the words, "Power punch" and King Zephion appears out of no where and punches Miguel right in the stomach. The echo of the punch could be heard miles away and Miguel shouts out in pain. Then the most astonishing thing happens, Miguel powers down but not of his own free will. "What did you do to me?" asks Miguel, who is great agony. "I punched the power out of you. You can no longer use that secret power of yours, boy" answers King Zephion. Tokan tosses the tree trunk that was on top of him. "Oh it seems my real competition is ready to fight again" thinks King Zephion as he turns and sees Tokan racing towards him. King Zephion vanishes out of sight and so does Tokan. "I didn't know Tokan could move that fast" states Resa. The sounds of thunder occur each time King Zephion and Tokan hit each other, but neither of them can be seen by a normal person. Then they appear up in the sky with Tokan holding King Zephion in a head lock. King Zephion eblows Tokan in the ribs causing himself to get free. King Zephion then kicks Tokan down to the ground and follows. Tokan hits the ground hard but still is able to get up. As he is getting up King Zephion swoops in, "Power punch" shouts King Zephion. Tokan grabs the forearm of the hand that King Zephion is attacking with. "At your current level you can't stop me, boy" says King Zephion. Tokan struggles trying to hold back King Zephion. "It seems that you are correct. Looks like I'll have to go up another level then" replies Tokan as he begins to power up one more time. "Power of the eternal flame" shouts Tokan. Tokan then begins to push away King Zephion's arm. King Zephion giggles and pulls back. "It seems that this power of yours is your last resort power" states King Zephion. Tokan just stares at him and then attacks. They get into another hyper speed battle. Then the moment Tokan goes flying into the ground once again. The dust made from the impact on the ground hides Tokan from his siblings. But as the dust clears everyone was shocked by what they saw. "Oh no, Tokan has powered down too" announces Snook.
<br><br>
The warriors race over to Tokan. "Well well, looks like the two strongest ones have fallen to me. I looks like it's time for me to finish you all off at once" says King Zephion. "We are the Elemental Warriors, you can never destroy us" replies Snook. Tokan stands to his feet and takes a deep breathe. "You may have taken away my new powers but I still have my original power. Fire!!!" shouts Tokan. "Earth!!!" shouts Miguel. "Wind!!!" shouts Resa. "Hahahaha like those messily power could stop me. I'm tired of playing all these games, here comes the end for you. Ultimate Death Ball!!!" says King Zephion. A big black devastating ball forms in King Zephion's hand as he has it raised to the sky. "Take this" yells King Zephion as he throws it at the warriors. "Diamond Shield" shouts Miguel. "Mega Flame Shield" shouts Tokan. "Wind Barrier" yells Resa. "Your barriers are to weak to hold my death ball for long" yells King Zephion.
