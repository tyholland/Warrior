A rip in the sky appears right above everyone. Someone's leg appears from the rip in the sky. Snook then starts to smile. "Miguel, I know who that is" says Snook. "What, what do you mean? How could you possibly know who that is?" responds Miguel. Snook starts shaking his arms in joy. Miguel looks at her as if she has just lost it. Half of the person's body is now coming through the rip. Finally the person has come completely into focus. It is none other than Tokan. Everyone looks in shock except for Snook. "Hey what's up?" says Tokan as he looks down at everyone. "How did you manage to find your way back here?" demands Viltron. "Well I'd like to tell you Viltron, but as you can see my bro and sis are trapped over there and it seems that Resa is in quite a bit of pain. So you'll have to excuse me while I help them real quick" responds Tokan as he vanishes. Moving at lighting speeds he appears in front of Viltron long enough to pick up Resa and then vanishes again. Then he appears in front of the barrier trapping Miguel and Snook, and blasts them free. "Thanks bro, but I was about to break us free" says Miguel. "Ha ha, yeah I just thought I would lend a hand." replies Tokan. Tokan places Resa gently on the ground. "You fought well sis, yo Snook can you heal Resa?" asks Tokan. "Yeah I'll give it a shot" answers Snook. "Alright good, I'm gonna go handle these guys then." says Tokan. "Yo bro, let me come along too. I got something new I want to show" says Miguel. "Hmm fine by me" replies Tokan. The minions, however, have become quite angry since the warriors have decided to take a momentary break during the battle royal. "Lets just destroy them. Just because he's faster doesn't mean anything. Plus Miguel isn't stronger than us anyways, so he will be no problem" says Felix. "I second that" responds Metelica. "Well their heading this way lets amp it up and finish it" says Viltron. Tokan and Miguel walk up to the minions. Then the minions power up, unleashing enormous amounts of power. Tokan and Miguel just stand where they're at and admire their power. The minions finish their power up and smirk because they have reached their maximums. "Very nice guys. Now it's my turn to show you something that I learned in the other dimension. It's a little different from how we normally power up but it's very effective" says Tokan. Tokan holds his left arm down in front of himself and he grabs the top of his left arm with his right hand. "Haaaaaa" yells Tokan as the fire symbol on his glove starts growing in size. Miguel looks upon Tokan in amazement and starts to get pushed back by Tokan's power up. The fire symbol is now the same height as Tokan and then it covers his body and then is consumed inside of Tokan. Now there is no symbol on his glove. Tokan looks up at the minions and in both of his eyes, they see the fire symbol. "Wow that was awesome Tokan" says Miguel. "Thanks bro, now what was it that you were gonna show us?" replies Tokan. "Oh right. Yo minions, tell me if you remember this" responds Miguel. Miguel starts to power up, and the ground around him begins to shake. A small crater forms around Miguel. "Isn't that his crazy insane power from before that you guys said he couldn't achieve again" says Metelica. "Haaaaa" shouts Miguel as his ultimate power unleashes once again. "Impressive bro, that's some power you got there" says Tokan. "Thanks, Snook helped me attain this" replies Miguel as he steps out of the small crater. "Well it looks like this battle is gonna continue" announces Tokan.
