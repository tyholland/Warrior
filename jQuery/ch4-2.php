So now Viltron, Felix, and Metelica face off against Tokan and Miguel. Viltron steps in front of Tokan and Felix steps in front of Miguel. Leaving Metelica with no one to fight at the moment. Then Metelica focuses his attention on Snook who is nursing Resa back to a better condition then the one she is in now. The others begin to fight, and Metelica decides to take out Snook and Resa while he has the chance. Metelica looks at Tokan and Miguel and sees that they are occupied and he rushes towards Snook. Tokan notices Metelica plan and turns to follow him and attack from behind. But Viltron quickly gets in his way, So Tokan decides to launch an attack at him from a distance. "Hold on Tokan, Snook can handle this guy" says Miguel. Tokan looks at Miguel and pulls back. "Yo Snook, heads up" yells Miguel. Snook turns and sees Metelica heading towards her. "There's nothing you can do now little girl. And your brothers can't help you either" says Metelica. Snook smiles at Metelica statement and brings her hands together to form a gun shape with her two index fingers pointing towards Metelica. "Actually they don't need to come to my aid this time. Because I have this new attack that even you can't stop" says Snook. Metelica stops charging towards Snook and says "Don't make me laugh girl, I already know that I'm stronger than you. Now take this." Metelica forms a Death Beam Ball in his right hand and raises it to the sky. "I see you and I raise you my new attack. Final Blow!!!" shouts Snook. Water from the atmosphere and surrounding areas come to the point of her index fingers. As all the water comes in, it forms a ball which is extremely bright in appearance. "Go on, I'll even let you attack first" says Metelica. Finally generating enough power Snook replies, "If you say so." Snook fires the blast making an execrating noise that sent chills dow everyone's spines. Thinking the blast couldn't possibly be that strong, Metelica goes to deflect it with his left hand. Then BOOM!!! The next thing Metelica sees is his arm being disintegrated by the blast. But the blast doesn't stop at Metelica, it continues heading towards Tokan, Miguel, Viltron, and Felix. "Get down!!!" shouts Miguel. All four of them drop to the ground as the blast flies over them. "Sorry Tokan and Miguel" says Snook from a far. "You little brat, you just took off my left arm. Now you're going to pay" say Metelica as he gets ready to unleash his attack that he was still holding in his right hand. When Tokan stand up and calmly shouts, "Flames of the Dragon." As a dragon of fire shoots out from his hand and rushes towards Metelica with lightening speed, and then engulfs him without warning. Snook stands in shock. "Wow cool attack bro" says Snook. "Thanks, now finish helping Resa" replies Tokan. "Tokan look out, behind you" says Miguel. Viltron comes flying at Tokan from behind with a sword. "Sword of Fire" yells Tokan as his sword generates out of thin air from fire. The two swords interlock making a clashing noise. Tokan then turns his head and looks at Viltron with a look of determination in his eyes.
<br><br>
Tokan then uses his strength and pushes Viltron back. The two battle fiercely with their swords, weaving in and out of close spots. Each close to losing an arm or two. Miguel however has engaged in his own battle with Felix. Felix is overwhelmed by Miguel's power once again. "How can this brat be more powerful than me" thinks Felix. Attack after attack, all Felix can do is defend. He can't get an opportunity to attack back. "What's wrong Felix, I thought you were stronger than this" says Miguel. "Shut up punk, and eat this. Mega Beam" replies Felix. Miguel vanishes and then reappears behind Felix. "You shouldn't get so overwhelmed Felix. Because you will lose sight of your opponent. Now tell me if you remember this attack. Sand Coffin" says Miguel. Felix's eyes open up wide as he remembers this particular attack. Then a coffin appears from the ground and it opened up. Felix tries to escape but Miguel hits him into the coffin. The coffin closes and Miguel closes his fists and the coffin crumbles, destroying Felix. Back to Tokan and Viltron's fight. Tokan knocked Viltron's sword out of his hands. "Oh too bad, you've lost your sword" says Tokan. "I don't need it to fight you" replies Viltron. Viltron attacks Tokan with his bare hands and releases his sword and blocks Viltron. While Tokan holds Viltron arm, Viltron blasts him with his free hand. Tokan goes flying backwards. Miguel looks over towards Tokan, and figures he's alright and then heads over to Snook, where she is healing Resa. Tokan gets back up and shouts, "Fire Up!!!" as his boy becomes covered in fire. "Now I'm going to finish this fight" says Tokan. Viltron looks on in fear, as Tokan starts to rush towards him. Tokan jumps up and starts to spin in a spiral motion, and flies right into Viltron. Viltron grabs ahold of Tokan's spiraling body and tries to push him back. But the fire surrounding Tokan's body and the force of his body is too much for Viltron, as he can't hold on anymore. Tokan goes right through Viltron's body, and then lights Viltron's body on fire.
