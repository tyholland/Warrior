Miguel feels as if something is wrong. He walks towards the front of the house to see if the minions had returned. He sees three minions but not the same three from before. "Hey are you guys also minions of King Zephion" states Miguel. "Yeah we are, and we are  under strict orders to destroy you" replies Viltron. "Well thats too bad because things aren't going to go according to your plan" says Miguel. "We shall see boy," answers Metelica. "Hey Resa, looks like we are going to have to fight a little sooner than we thought." says Miguel. "Hmm not a problem, I'm actually looking forward to taking these guys down." responds Resa as she walks up next to Miguel. The minions start walking towards the two warriors. "Hold up now, I don't think we said to start yet. Now let me ask you guys, have you ever played darts?" says Miguel. "No, what is this game you speak of?" replies Rex. Miguel raises his hands and then the ground before him starts to separate and spikes made from the ground come up. The spikes then point at the minions. "Well the game is pretty simple. You have darts or in our case spikes, and you just throw then at your target" says Miguel as he smiles and releases the spikes, sending them flying at the minions. Viltron, Metelica, and Rex all dodge the attacks but are caught off guard by Resa who was waiting for them to move before she attacked. "Wind Shotgun" says Resa as she forms her right hand to look like a gun. BOOM!!! She fires her first shot which hits Rex square in the chest. Rex goes flying. "Wow that sounded like a real gun" says Miguel. "Yeah I know, and I don't even run out of bullets" replies Resa joking. "Shinning Glare!!!" shouts Viltron as a bright light comes from his hands blinding Miguel and Resa. Metelica swoops in and punches Miguel in the stomach and power kicks Resa in the chest sending her flying right into a huge rock knocking her out. Miguel gets back up and decks Metelica right in the face with a right hook. Viltron attacks Miguel from his left, but Miguel blocks the attack. Miguel turns to counter the attack when Rex hits him with a energy blast and Miguel drops to his knees. "I hope you didn't forget about me" says Rex. The three minions commence an simultaneous attack on Miguel, who is able to block the attacks but has no opening to attack them. All of a sudden the temperature drops and it gets really cold. Miguel, Viltron, Metelica, and Rex stop fighting and see Resa standing holding her hands up in the air. "Twister Blast" she yells as she makes a twister that engulfs the minions and sends them spinning. Resa then directs the twister up into space. "Well I guess we won't be seeing them for a while" says Miguel sarcastically. "Yup. Now lets go find Tokan and Snook because I bet the three we saw from earlier today might attack them." replies Resa. "Ok lets go" responds Miguel.
<br>
<br>
"Alright Snook, lets head back home. This door will do," says Tokan. "Yeah I like it. Lets go" replies Snook. Up above in the sky, Tankur spots Tokan and Snook. "Hey Felix there are the other two right below." states Tankur. "Alright, that was quick. Lets go and say hi" responds Felix. The three minions float down right in front of Tokan's vehicle. "Umm Tokan, we have company," says Snook. Tokan turns to see who is speaking of. "Oh joy, the three stooges are back" says Tokan. "Boy you won't be making anymore of your jokes when we are done with you" replies Sphinx. Tokan tells Snook to stand back and he then activates his power. "Fire!!!" shouts Tokan. "Lets do this" says Felix. Felix attacks Tokan and so does Sphinx. Tankur holds off for the moment. Tokan handles himself against the two fighters. He's able to get a few attacks off, but the majority of the time he is blocking their attacks. BOOM!!! Tokan gets punch in the face by Sphinx and drops to the ground. Felix then kicks Tokan in the stomach. Tokan goes spinning into a light post. The light post falls over and then a crowd of citizens start to form around the fight. Tankur, who has been patiently waiting, jumps in from out of nowhere and lands knees first into Tokan's back. "Ahhhh" yells Tokan in pain. Tokan rolls away from Tankur and grasps for air. He takes a deep breath and says, "Wall of Fire" and creates a wall of fire around Tankur. "Thats new" states Felix. Tokan holds out his hands and starts to bring them closer. As he does that the walls of fire surrounding Tankur start to close in on him. Tankur tries to push the walls back but the heat is too much for him. "Help me out guys" yells Tankur. "Always getting into trouble and needing us to bail you out." replies Sphinx as he hits Tokan from the back with a energy blast which causes Tokan to release the walls of fire. "Tokan!!!" screams Snook. The crowd of people watching the fight whisper amongst each other wondering what is going on and why these fighters have powers. Snook, scared for Tokan's life, quickly activates her power for the first time. "Water!!!" yells Snook as tears come down her cheeks. Tokan looks up as he hears Snook activate her power. "Tidal Wave" screams Snook. She directs her attack at Felix and Sphinx but nothing happens. "Ha she can't even get her powers to work" says Felix as he laughs. Then Tokan looks around because he can hear the sound of water flowing at rapid speeds. Then the next thing he saw was a tidal wave coming from behind Snook. "Take this" shouts Snook as she directs her hands down and the wave follows going after Felix and Sphinx. Felix and Sphinx are carried by the wave right into a building. The continued pressure of the water makes it so that they can't move. Tankur starts running towards Snook to stop her.  "Line of fire" says Tokan, as he creates a barrier between Snook and Tankur. Tankur stops in front of the fire. "You're not getting by today" says Tokan as he gets up and starts walking towards Tankur. "You can't stop me, you're already too injured" replies Tankur. Tokan smirks as he walks closer to Tankur. Tokans fists get a ball of fire around them. "I'm going to use you as my own personal punching bag" says Tokan. "Thats not going to happen" replies Tankur as he makes a triangle with his two hands and blasts and energy blast. Tokan bats it away with his fists, and begins to unleash a fury of fiery punches on Tankur. "Tokan I can't hold this wave any longer." says Snook. "Alright Snook, let it go" replies Tokan. Snook releases her attack and Felix and Sphinx drop to their knees. "Your mine little girl" shouts Sphinx out of breath. Sphinx charges at Snook and then BAAM!!! He slams right into a cement wall. Sphinx stumbles back, "Where did that come from" he said. "It came from yours truly" replied Miguel. "I thought the other three were dealing with you" said Felix. "They were but they're hanging around right now" replies Resa as she smirks. Tokan puts his right foot on top of Tankur in victory. "Looks like you guys should step your game up, cause you're losing." says Tokan. "I doubt that boy. Destructive Blast!!!" says Felix and he raises his hands in the air and a black orb forms getting bigger and bigger. "That doesn't look good" says Miguel. "Take this you little brats" yells Felix as he throws his destructive blast at the four warriors. With the blast rushes right at them the four warriors each think of the strongest attack for their element. "Flames of Fury Ha!!!" shouts Tokan. "Hurricane!!!" screams Resa. "Tsunami!!!" yells Snook. The three attacks go head on against the destructive blast. "Clear Diamond Shield" yells Miguel as he creates a barrier to protect him and his siblings from the after shock of the blasts. KABOOM!!! The attacks collide and the force of the explosion pushes Felix and Sphinx back. After the area clears, the elemental warriors stand firm staring down Felix and Sphinx. Tankur is still on the ground near the elemental warriors. At that very moment Denku suddenly communicates with the warriors. "Warriors, I forgot to tell you that Miguel's element allows for him to call upon the eternal gate of prison that they trap whoever you put into it. All he has to do is call for it and it will come." says Denku through his thoughts to their thoughts. "Miguel did u get that" says Tokan. "Yeah I'm already on it" replies Miguel. "Eternal Gate of Prison" yells Miguel. Then right in front of Miguel the eternal gate of prison forms in the shape of a golden circle and the doors open. "Quick throw Tankur in there" says Resa. So Tokan picks up Tankur and tosses him through the gate. "No!!!" shouts Tankur but it is too late for him. "Crap they got Tankur. They are starting to get to strong, we got to regroup." says Sphinx. "Alright lets go for now" replies Felix. Then Felix and Sphinx fly off once again. The crowds of people watching the fight start clapping and cheering for the warriors. The warriors look around at the people and wave to everyone. A reporter shouts, "Who are you guys?" Snook replies, "We are the elemental warriors." Tokan looks at his siblings and signals for them to exit the scene and they quickly vanish.
